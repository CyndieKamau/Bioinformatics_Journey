## Day One As A Bioinformatics Intern At ICIPE 
HI!! My name is Cyndie! I'm currently a Bioinformatics intern at ICIPE, Kenya, Cohort 6 ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ¥³
Well what can I say! In this cold cold day, we officially kickstarted the journey!
I'll take you through everything we learn during the course of the four months, arranged in weekly files in this repo.
This repo won't have much of technicalities, but rather personal observations and experiences.
Buckle up my people!

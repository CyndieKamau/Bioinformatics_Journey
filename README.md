## Day One As A Bioinformatics Intern At ICIPE


HI!! My name is Cyndie! I'm currently a Bioinformatics intern at ICIPE, Kenya, Cohort 6 ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ¥³


Well what can I say! In this cold cold day (12th July 2022), we officially kickstarted the journey!


I'll take you through everything we learn during the course of the four months, arranged in weekly files in this repo.


This repo won't have much of technicalities, but rather personal observations and experiences.


Buckle up my people!

## 1. Vision Statement
My vision is to be a hardcore pythonista. Be so good I can design highly secure systems and algorithms to boost scientific research. Harness the           cloud compute power to amp up big data analytics. Finally, with a security-driven approach, pen test these systems to eliminate as much           vulnerabilities as possible.

- Design
- Build
- Secure
- Repeat.


## 2. Mission Statement

> One Piece Of Code At A Time.


Being a Diligent, Efficient, Trustworthy and Committed intern, teammate and collaborator.
